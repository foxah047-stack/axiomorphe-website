    <h1>Economic System</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">The economic system maintains free markets and competition while addressing automation-driven job displacement through redistribution and universal services. It combines market efficiency with social protection, ensuring technological progress benefits everyone rather than concentrating wealth among platform owners and capital holders.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Core Principle</h2>
      <p>Establish economic security for all citizens while addressing wealth concentration and automation-driven job displacement. Generate revenue from those with extreme wealth and from automation gains to fund universal services and basic income.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>First Term Implementation Framework</h2>
      <p>The following components represent the essential foundation to be established in a first term of governance. Implementation details are left to economists, tax policy experts, and specialists to determine optimal approaches.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Year 1 Priorities</h2>

      <h3>1. Wealth Tax (Incremental Curve Structure)</h3>
      
      <p><strong>What:</strong> Annual tax on net worth above a threshold (e.g., $50 million), using a continuous progressive curve rather than discrete brackets.</p>

      <p><strong>Why Incremental Curve vs. Traditional Brackets:</strong></p>
      <p>Traditional bracket systems create cliffs where tax rates jump suddenly, encouraging gaming and creating artificial ceilings on wealth accumulation. This discourages competition and growth.</p>

      <p>An incremental curve structure eliminates these problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No gaming opportunities:</strong> No thresholds to structure assets around</li>
        <li><strong>Preserves competition:</strong> Every dollar of wealth growth faces marginally higher tax, but increase is smooth and proportional—not prohibitive</li>
        <li><strong>Maintains innovation incentive:</strong> Billionaires continue competing to build larger companies because growth remains worthwhile</li>
        <li><strong>Economically rational:</strong> Reflects actual diminishing marginal utility of wealth</li>
        <li><strong>Harder to evade:</strong> Continuous function eliminates strategic positioning at bracket boundaries</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Tax the accumulation, not the ambition.</strong> The curve ensures those building from $100M to $10B keep competing and innovating, while progressively contributing more as they succeed.</p>

      <p><strong>Example curve concept:</strong> Rate starts at 0% below threshold, then increases smoothly—perhaps 1% at $100M, 2% at $500M, 2.5% at $1B, 3.5% at $10B, approaching but not exceeding a ceiling around 4-5% at extreme wealth levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Implementation details:</strong> Economists and mathematicians determine optimal curve formula (polynomial, logarithmic, or piecewise smooth functions), specific parameters, valuation methodologies for different asset types, enforcement mechanisms, and international coordination needs.</p>

      <p><strong>Revenue:</strong> $300-500 billion annually</p>
      <p><strong>Use:</strong> Fund Medicare for All implementation, infrastructure, climate investment, education</p>

      <h3>2. Medicare for All (Single-Payer)</h3>
      
      <p><strong>What:</strong> Single-payer national health system. Everyone covered automatically from birth. Federal program, not state-by-state.</p>

      <p><strong>Coverage:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>All medically necessary care: medical, dental, vision, hearing</li>
        <li>Mental health and addiction treatment</li>
        <li>Prescription drugs with negotiated prices</li>
        <li>Long-term care and home healthcare</li>
        <li>Reproductive healthcare</li>
        <li>Preventive care</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Free at Point of Service:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>No premiums, deductibles, or copays</li>
        <li>No networks or pre-authorizations</li>
        <li>No medical bills ever</li>
        <li>Show card, get care</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Private Insurance:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eliminated for duplicative coverage</li>
        <li>May exist only for elective/cosmetic procedures not covered by Medicare for All</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Why Single-Payer:</strong> Healthcare is a human right. The current system leaves 30 million uninsured, bankrupts families, and costs double what other countries pay for worse outcomes. Single-payer eliminates insurance company profit-seeking, reduces administrative waste from 30% to 2%, and ensures everyone gets care regardless of employment or income. If Medicare works for seniors, it works for everyone.</p>

      <p><strong>Funding:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Progressive income tax (4% on income over $29,000)</li>
        <li>Employer payroll tax (7.5% - saves employers money vs. current premiums)</li>
        <li>Wealth tax and progressive income tax on top earners</li>
        <li>Total system cost: $3-3.5 trillion annually (vs. $4.5 trillion current system)</li>
        <li>Saves $1-1.5 trillion annually while covering everyone</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Implementation details:</strong> Healthcare policy experts determine transition timeline, provider payment structures, drug price negotiation mechanisms, and workforce planning. Four-year transition with immediate coverage for children and phased eligibility expansion.</p>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Universal single-payer coverage achieved within first term</p>

      <h3>3. Antitrust Enforcement</h3>
      
      <p><strong>What:</strong> Break up monopolies and restore market competition, particularly in technology platforms.</p>

      <p><strong>Why:</strong> Platform monopolies distort markets, exploit consumers and workers, and prevent genuine competition.</p>

      <p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>File breakup suits against major tech platforms</li>
        <li>Block anti-competitive mergers</li>
        <li>Mandate interoperability (data portability, open APIs, cross-platform communication)</li>
        <li>Ban anti-competitive practices (exclusivity deals, predatory pricing, self-preferencing)</li>
        <li>Provide public funding for startup competitors, especially cooperatives</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Implementation details:</strong> Antitrust lawyers and economists determine which companies to target, breakup structures, interoperability standards, merger approval criteria, and enforcement priorities.</p>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> At least one major tech company breakup in progress by Year 2</p>

      <h3>4. Worker Protections</h3>
      
      <p><strong>What:</strong> Strengthen labor rights and standards to protect workers in the transition to automated economy.</p>

      <p><strong>Components:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimum wage increase indexed to cost of living and productivity</li>
        <li>Gig workers classified as employees with full protections</li>
        <li>Paid family leave (federal mandate)</li>
        <li>Strengthened union rights and collective bargaining</li>
        <li>Ban non-compete agreements to increase labor mobility</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Implementation details:</strong> Labor economists and policy experts determine optimal wage levels, phase-in schedules, industry-specific considerations, and enforcement mechanisms.</p>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Millions benefiting from enhanced protections by end of Year 1</p>

      <h3>5. Progressive Tax Reform</h3>
      
      <p><strong>What:</strong> Higher rates on top earners, close loopholes, ensure tax fairness.</p>

      <p><strong>Components:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase top marginal income tax rates</li>
        <li>Tax capital gains as ordinary income</li>
        <li>Corporate minimum tax with rates scaled to market share</li>
        <li>Close offshore loopholes and eliminate tax havens</li>
        <li>Strengthen IRS enforcement capacity</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Implementation details:</strong> Tax policy experts determine optimal rate structures, loophole closure priorities, international coordination needs, and enforcement strategies.</p>

      <p><strong>Revenue:</strong> Additional $200-300 billion annually</p>
      <p><strong>Use:</strong> General services, education, infrastructure, deficit reduction</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Year 2 Priorities</h2>

      <h3>6. Automation Dividend Tax</h3>
      
      <p><strong>What:</strong> Tax on companies based on their automation and AI deployment, ensuring society shares productivity gains from technology.</p>

      <p><strong>Why This Is Essential:</strong></p>
      <p>Wealth tax alone cannot solve the automation displacement problem. Wealth tax is indirect and slow—it taxes accumulated wealth years after automation occurs. Automation dividend tax is direct and immediate—it taxes the act of automation itself, generating revenue exactly when workers are displaced.</p>

      <p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Company deploys robots/AI and eliminates 1,000 jobs</li>
        <li>Saves $40-60 million annually in labor costs</li>
        <li>Profits increase, but wealth doesn't immediately concentrate in taxable billionaire holdings</li>
        <li>Workers need income support NOW, not years later when wealth tax catches up</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Automation dividend tax creates direct link: automate → pay tax → fund UBI for displaced workers. Revenue flows immediately when automation happens, exactly when workers need support.</p>

      <p><strong>What Gets Taxed:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Industrial robots deployed</li>
        <li>Autonomous vehicles replacing drivers</li>
        <li>AI systems replacing human roles</li>
        <li>Workforce reduction relative to revenue (productivity-based metrics)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Tax Structure Options:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Per-unit:</strong> $X per robot/autonomous vehicle/AI agent annually</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity-based:</strong> Tax on revenue-per-employee ratio (high ratio indicates automation)</li>
        <li><strong>Displacement-based:</strong> Tax on "ghost workers" (jobs that would exist without automation)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Why This Works:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Makes companies internalize social cost of automation</li>
        <li>Doesn't ban automation—just ensures gains are shared</li>
        <li>Revenue scales with automation pace (more automation = more tax = more UBI)</li>
        <li>Funds UBI exactly when workers need it most</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Implementation details:</strong> Economists and technology specialists determine measurement methodologies, rate structures, industry-specific adjustments, phase-in schedules, and enforcement mechanisms.</p>

      <p><strong>Revenue:</strong> $500 billion - $1 trillion annually (scales with automation deployment)</p>
      <p><strong>Use:</strong> Universal Basic Income (UBI) for all citizens, with emphasis on displaced workers</p>

      <h3>7. Universal Basic Income Pilot Programs</h3>
      
      <p><strong>What:</strong> Unconditional cash payments to all residents in select regions to test UBI before national rollout.</p>

      <p><strong>Why Pilots First:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prove concept with rigorous data</li>
        <li>Build political support through demonstrated success</li>
        <li>Work out implementation challenges</li>
        <li>Study effects on employment, health, crime, education</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>3-5 diverse regions or cities</li>
        <li>$500-1,000 per month per adult</li>
        <li>2+ year duration extending into second term</li>
        <li>Comprehensive evaluation with control groups</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Funding:</strong> Automation dividend tax revenue (direct link between automation and worker support)</p>

      <p><strong>Implementation details:</strong> Policy researchers determine pilot locations, payment amounts, duration, evaluation metrics, control group design, and expansion criteria.</p>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> 500,000 - 1 million participants by Year 2, generating evidence for national expansion in second term</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Complete Revenue Structure</h2>
      
      <h3>Three Complementary Revenue Streams</h3>

      <p><strong>1. Wealth Tax (Incremental Curve)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revenue: $300-500 billion annually</li>
        <li>Funds: Healthcare, infrastructure, climate investment, education</li>
        <li>Addresses: Past wealth accumulation and ongoing inequality</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>2. Automation Dividend Tax</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revenue: $500 billion - $1 trillion annually (scales with automation)</li>
        <li>Funds: Universal Basic Income</li>
        <li>Addresses: Real-time job displacement from automation</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>3. Progressive Income Tax Reform</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revenue: Additional $200-300 billion annually</li>
        <li>Funds: General services, education, deficit reduction</li>
        <li>Addresses: Income inequality</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Total New Revenue:</strong> $1 - 1.8 trillion annually</p>

      <p><strong>Why Three Streams:</strong> Each addresses different aspects of the economic challenge. Wealth tax captures past accumulation. Automation tax captures ongoing technological displacement. Income tax maintains progressive structure for labor income. Together, they provide comprehensive funding for universal services and basic income.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Success Metrics (End of Year 2)</h2>
      <p>The following benchmarks indicate successful first-term implementation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wealth tax generating $300-500 billion annually</li>
        <li>Medicare for All transition underway with universal coverage achieved or imminent</li>
        <li>Major tech monopoly breakup initiated</li>
        <li>Worker protections benefiting millions (minimum wage, paid leave, gig worker classification)</li>
        <li>Automation tax framework established and collecting revenue</li>
        <li>UBI pilots running with 500,000 - 1 million participants</li>
        <li>Measurable reduction in economic inequality</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Guiding Principles for Implementation</h2>
      <p>For economists, policy experts, and specialists tasked with implementing this framework:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Evidence-based:</strong> Use data, run pilots, evaluate rigorously before scaling</li>
        <li><strong>Pragmatic:</strong> What works in practice matters more than ideological purity</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible:</strong> Adjust based on results and changing conditions, not rigid adherence to initial designs</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Publish methodologies, invite scrutiny, explain decisions publicly</li>
        <li><strong>Iterative:</strong> Start smaller, learn from experience, expand based on evidence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The framework provides direction and principles. Experts provide precision and optimization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why This Approach Succeeds</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Addresses Root Causes:</strong> Tackles wealth concentration (wealth tax), automation displacement (automation dividend tax), and market failure (antitrust) simultaneously.</p>

      <p><strong>Preserves Market Dynamics:</strong> Competition continues, innovation proceeds, entrepreneurship thrives—but within structure that shares gains and protects workers.</p>

      <p><strong>Politically Viable:</strong> Gradual implementation, proven models (Australia healthcare), popular policies (antitrust, worker protections), evidence-based approach (UBI pilots).</p>

      <p><strong>Economically Sustainable:</strong> Revenue streams scale with economic activity. More wealth = more wealth tax. More automation = more automation tax. Self-adjusting funding.</p>

      <p><strong>Future-Proof:</strong> Designed specifically for automated economy. Addresses technological unemployment directly. Adapts as automation accelerates.</p>
