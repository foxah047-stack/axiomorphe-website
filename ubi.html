    <h1>Universal Basic Income (UBI)</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">Unconditional cash payments to all citizens, funded by automation dividend tax. Provides economic security as automation accelerates job displacement. Pilot programs in Year 2 to prove concept, national rollout in second term based on evidence.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Core Concept</h2>
      
      <p><strong>What:</strong> Regular, unconditional cash payments to all adult citizens regardless of employment status, income level, or wealth.</p>

      <p><strong>Why:</strong> Automation will displace jobs faster than new ones are created. Not everyone can retrain due to age, disability, or aptitude. Service jobs don't pay enough to live. We're productive enough as a society to provide for everyone.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Universal Basic Income is economic security for the automated age.</strong> It's not charity—it's a dividend on shared productivity gains from technology. If robots and AI do the work, everyone shares the benefits.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why UBI Is Inevitable</h2>

      <h3>Automation Reality</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Job displacement accelerating:</strong> AI and robotics eliminating jobs across sectors (manufacturing, transportation, customer service, knowledge work)</li>
        <li><strong>Retraining inadequate:</strong> Can't retrain everyone fast enough; some jobs simply disappearing</li>
        <li><strong>Age barriers:</strong> 50-year-old trucker can't easily become software engineer</li>
        <li><strong>Aptitude limitations:</strong> Not everyone suited for remaining high-skill jobs</li>
        <li><strong>Speed mismatch:</strong> Automation happening faster than economy creates new jobs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Current System Failing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gig economy = precarity:</strong> Unstable income, no benefits, no security</li>
        <li><strong>Service jobs insufficient:</strong> Retail and food service don't pay living wage</li>
        <li><strong>Safety net inadequate:</strong> Unemployment insurance temporary, welfare stigmatized and complex</li>
        <li><strong>Wealth concentrating:</strong> Automation profits go to capital owners, not displaced workers</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Economic Transformation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Productivity uncoupled from employment:</strong> GDP grows while jobs shrink</li>
        <li><strong>Sufficient abundance:</strong> We produce enough for everyone—distribution is the problem</li>
        <li><strong>Moral imperative:</strong> Can't let people starve when technology makes their labor unnecessary</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>UBI Structure</h2>

      <h3>Who Receives UBI</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>All adult citizens:</strong> Age 18+ (U.S. citizens and permanent residents)</li>
        <li><strong>Universal:</strong> No means testing, no work requirements, no conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Individual:</strong> Each adult receives payment directly (not household-based)</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic:</strong> Enrollment through Social Security number or tax system</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Payment Amount Options</h3>

      <p><strong>Three tiers based on funding availability:</strong></p>

      <div class="comparison">
        <h3>Option A: Supplemental UBI</h3>
        <p><strong>Amount:</strong> $200-300 per month per adult</p>
        <p><strong>Total cost:</strong> $200/month × 260M adults × 12 months = $624B annually</p>
        <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Supplement to employment income, not replacement. Covers basic expenses when combined with work or other support.</p>
        <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Achievable with automation tax revenue alone ($500B-$1T)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="comparison">
        <h3>Option B: Basic Security UBI</h3>
        <p><strong>Amount:</strong> $500-700 per month per adult</p>
        <p><strong>Total cost:</strong> $600/month × 260M adults × 12 months = $1.87T annually</p>
        <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Covers minimal living expenses (food, basic housing contribution, utilities). Requires combining with part-time work for most.</p>
        <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Requires automation tax + wealth tax + some existing welfare consolidation</p>
      </div>

      <div class="comparison">
        <h3>Option C: Full UBI (Long-term Goal)</h3>
        <p><strong>Amount:</strong> $1,000-1,500 per month per adult</p>
        <p><strong>Total cost:</strong> $1,200/month × 260M adults × 12 months = $3.74T annually</p>
        <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Living wage. Can survive on UBI alone, though most will supplement with work.</p>
        <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Requires full automation tax maturity, replacement of most welfare programs, potentially second-term expansion</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Recommended Approach: Progressive Implementation</h3>

      <p><strong>Start with Option A (Supplemental UBI):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Politically achievable with automation tax revenue</li>
        <li>Provides meaningful support without overwhelming system</li>
        <li>$200-300/month makes difference for struggling families</li>
        <li>Builds evidence for expansion</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Scale up based on:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automation tax revenue growth (more automation = more funding)</li>
        <li>Pilot program results showing benefits</li>
        <li>Political support increasing as people see results</li>
        <li>Labor market changes (if displacement accelerates, increase UBI)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Funding Structure</h2>

      <h3>Primary Source: Automation Dividend Tax</h3>

      <div class="calculation">
Automation Tax Revenue: $500B - $1T annually
260M adults in US

Baseline calculation:
$500B ÷ 260M = $1,923 per person per year
= $160 per month per adult

If automation accelerates:
$1T ÷ 260M = $3,846 per person per year
= $320 per month per adult
      </div>

      <p><strong>Direct connection:</strong> Companies pay automation tax when displacing workers → Revenue funds UBI for those workers. Clear, transparent, politically defensible.</p>

      <h3>Supplemental Funding (if needed for higher amounts)</h3>

      <p><strong>Wealth tax contribution:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary wealth tax revenue ($300-500B) funds healthcare and infrastructure</li>
        <li>If automation tax insufficient, redirect portion to UBI</li>
        <li>Or increase wealth tax rates slightly to fund higher UBI</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Existing program consolidation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some existing means-tested programs become redundant with UBI</li>
        <li>SNAP (food stamps): ~$80B annually</li>
        <li>TANF (welfare): ~$30B annually</li>
        <li>Housing assistance (partial): ~$30B annually</li>
        <li>Total potential: ~$140B annually</li>
        <li><strong>Keep:</strong> Social Security (earned benefit), Medicare/Medicaid (healthcare separate), disability benefits</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Total funding sources:</strong></p>
      <div class="calculation">
Automation dividend tax:    $500B - $1T
Wealth tax (if needed):     $100B - $200B
Program consolidation:      $100B - $140B
───────────────────────────────────────
Total available:            $700B - $1.34T

Supports: $225-430 per month per adult
      </div>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Scaling mechanism:</strong> As automation accelerates and displaces more workers, automation tax revenue automatically increases, which increases UBI payments exactly when they're needed most. Self-adjusting system.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Pilot Programs (Year 2)</h2>

      <h3>Why Pilots First</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prove concept:</strong> Generate rigorous data showing UBI works</li>
        <li><strong>Build political support:</strong> Demonstrated success convinces skeptics</li>
        <li><strong>Work out implementation:</strong> Test payment systems, identify issues, refine approach</li>
        <li><strong>Study effects:</strong> Employment, health, crime, education, entrepreneurship, family stability</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce risk:</strong> Learn from small-scale before national rollout</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pilot Structure</h3>

      <p><strong>Locations:</strong> 3-5 diverse regions representing different economic conditions</p>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example Pilot Sites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rust Belt city:</strong> Flint, MI or Youngstown, OH (manufacturing decline, high unemployment)</li>
          <li><strong>Rural area:</strong> Appalachian region or Central Valley, CA (agricultural economy, poverty)</li>
          <li><strong>Tech-adjacent city:</strong> Austin, TX or Raleigh, NC (growing economy, tech automation)</li>
          <li><strong>Urban low-income:</strong> Parts of Detroit, Baltimore, or Newark (concentrated poverty, diverse population)</li>
          <li><strong>Small town:</strong> Stockton, CA model (already ran pilot) or similar (middle America, retail/service economy)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Participants:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>500,000 - 1 million total participants across all sites</li>
        <li>All adult residents in selected areas eligible</li>
        <li>Control groups in similar areas not receiving UBI (for comparison)</li>
        <li>Random selection where participant numbers limited</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Payment amounts:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Test multiple levels: $500, $750, $1,000 per month</li>
        <li>Different sites get different amounts (compare effects)</li>
        <li>Paid monthly via direct deposit or debit card</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Duration:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimum 2 years (Year 2-3 of first term)</li>
        <li>Extend into second term if data promising</li>
        <li>Long enough to observe behavior changes, short enough to be politically acceptable pilot</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>

      <p><strong>Economic outcomes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Employment rates (do people stop working?)</li>
        <li>Wage levels (does UBI increase bargaining power?)</li>
        <li>Entrepreneurship (new business formation)</li>
        <li>Poverty rates and financial stability</li>
        <li>Debt levels and savings rates</li>
        <li>Local economic activity (spending patterns)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Social outcomes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Health indicators (physical and mental health improvements)</li>
        <li>Education outcomes (high school graduation, college enrollment)</li>
        <li>Crime rates (does security reduce desperation crime?)</li>
        <li>Family stability (divorce rates, child welfare)</li>
        <li>Housing stability (evictions, homelessness)</li>
        <li>Substance abuse (addiction treatment engagement)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Political outcomes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public opinion tracking (support for UBI over time)</li>
        <li>Participant satisfaction surveys</li>
        <li>Community stakeholder perspectives (business owners, local government)</li>
        <li>Media coverage and narrative shifts</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Research Design</h3>

      <p><strong>Randomized controlled trial (RCT) where possible:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Treatment group receives UBI</li>
        <li>Control group in similar area does not</li>
        <li>Compare outcomes between groups</li>
        <li>Gold standard for causal inference</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Comprehensive data collection:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Baseline surveys before UBI starts</li>
        <li>Quarterly surveys during pilot</li>
        <li>Administrative data (employment records, tax data, health records with consent)</li>
        <li>Qualitative interviews (understand lived experience)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Independent evaluation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Academic researchers from universities conduct evaluation</li>
        <li>Multiple research teams for robustness</li>
        <li>Pre-registered analysis plans (prevent cherry-picking results)</li>
        <li>Public data release (transparency and replication)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Expected Pilot Costs</h3>

      <div class="calculation">
750,000 participants × $750/month × 12 months = $6.75B per year
2-year pilot = $13.5B total

Plus:
Evaluation and research: $500M
Administration and systems: $1B
Payment infrastructure: $500M
───────────────────────────────────────
Total pilot cost: ~$15.5B over 2 years

Funded by: Automation dividend tax (less than 2% of revenue)
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>National Rollout (Second Term)</h2>

      <h3>Decision Criteria</h3>

      <p><strong>Proceed to national UBI if pilots show:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimal employment reduction (people continue working)</li>
        <li>Improved health and social outcomes</li>
        <li>Positive local economic effects</li>
        <li>Strong public support (>60% approval)</li>
        <li>No major implementation failures</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Adjust approach if pilots reveal:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Optimal payment amounts (higher or lower than tested)</li>
        <li>Better delivery mechanisms (payment frequency, method)</li>
        <li>Need for complementary programs (job training, childcare)</li>
        <li>Geographic variations requiring different approaches</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Phase-In Strategy</h3>

      <p><strong>Year 1 (Second Term):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expand pilots to 20-30 additional cities/regions</li>
        <li>5-10 million participants</li>
        <li>Begin building national payment infrastructure</li>
        <li>Continue evaluation and refinement</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Year 2 (Second Term):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Universal enrollment system operational</li>
        <li>Start national payments for priority groups:
          <ul>
            <li>Workers in industries with high automation (manufacturing, transportation)</li>
            <li>Young adults 18-25 (help with education/training transition)</li>
            <li>Low-income households (immediate poverty relief)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>30-50 million participants</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Year 3 (Second Term):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expand to all adults in states that opt-in (voluntary at first)</li>
        <li>100-150 million participants</li>
        <li>Federal matching funds incentivize state participation</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Year 4 (Second Term):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Universal coverage: all 260M adults</li>
        <li>Full national UBI operational</li>
        <li>Payment amounts adjust based on automation tax revenue</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Payment Infrastructure</h3>

      <p><strong>Delivery mechanism:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct deposit:</strong> Default for those with bank accounts (via Social Security system)</li>
        <li><strong>Prepaid debit card:</strong> For unbanked individuals (government-issued, no fees)</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly payments:</strong> Predictable and regular (same date each month)</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic enrollment:</strong> No application required (via SSN/tax system)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Technology systems:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leverage existing Social Security Administration infrastructure</li>
        <li>IRS integration for verification and tax coordination</li>
        <li>Modern payment rails (ACH, real-time payments)</li>
        <li>Fraud detection and prevention systems</li>
        <li>Customer service and dispute resolution</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Cost to administer:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Target: <1% of total UBI payments (similar to Social Security efficiency)</li>
        <li>For $600B program: <$6B annual admin costs</li>
        <li>Economies of scale and automation keep costs low</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Addressing Common Concerns</h2>

      <h3>"People Will Stop Working"</h3>

      <p><strong>Evidence says no:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (40+ years): no employment effects</li>
        <li>Cherokee casino payments: recipients work same amount</li>
        <li>Stockton pilot: employment actually increased</li>
        <li>Finland/Kenya pilots: minimal work reduction, mostly positive transitions</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Why people keep working:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>UBI provides basic security, not luxury lifestyle</li>
        <li>Most people want purpose and social connection work provides</li>
        <li>Additional income from work significantly improves quality of life</li>
        <li>Social norms around work remain strong</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Who might work less (and that's okay):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Parents with young children (more time with kids = good)</li>
        <li>Students (focus on education = investment in future)</li>
        <li>Caregivers for elderly/disabled (unpaid labor currently)</li>
        <li>People in exploitative jobs (increased bargaining power = good)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>"This Is Too Expensive"</h3>

      <p><strong>Cost in context:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>UBI at $300/month: $936B annually (5% of GDP)</li>
        <li>Current federal budget: ~$6.5T</li>
        <li>Current spending on poverty programs: ~$900B</li>
        <li>UBI replaces some programs, supplements others</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>It pays for itself:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced poverty = lower healthcare costs (ER visits, chronic illness)</li>
        <li>Reduced crime = lower incarceration costs ($80B annually)</li>
        <li>Better education = higher lifetime earnings = more tax revenue</li>
        <li>Economic stimulus = job creation = more economic activity</li>
        <li>Reduced homelessness = lower emergency services costs</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Compare to alternatives:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mass unemployment without support: social collapse, crime, political extremism</li>
        <li>Complex means-tested welfare: bureaucratic, stigmatizing, poverty traps</li>
        <li>UBI: simple, universal, preserves dignity, enables adaptation to automation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>"Inflation Will Eat It All"</h3>

      <p><strong>UBI is not inflationary when funded by taxes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Money transferred from wealthy to everyone, not printed</li>
        <li>Automation tax captures productivity gains, redistributes them</li>
        <li>Increased demand met by increased supply (automation makes production cheaper)</li>
        <li>Housing inflation: address separately with housing policy</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Mechanisms that prevent inflation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Productive capacity increases with automation (supply grows)</li>
        <li>Competition keeps prices down (markets still function)</li>
        <li>Fed can adjust interest rates if inflation emerges</li>
        <li>UBI grows slowly over time (not sudden shock to system)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Historical evidence:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alaska Permanent Fund: no inflation effects over 40+ years</li>
        <li>Pandemic stimulus checks: temporary inflation due to supply chain disruption, not demand</li>
        <li>Most inflation concerns theoretical, not empirical</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>"Landlords Will Just Raise Rent"</h3>

      <p><strong>Housing requires separate policy:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Progressive property taxation (see housing system) limits rent extraction</li>
        <li>Vacancy penalties discourage speculation</li>
        <li>Accumulation multiplier makes large-scale landlording expensive</li>
        <li>Increased housing supply through zoning reform</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>UBI increases housing options:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can afford to move to lower-cost areas (not trapped by job location)</li>
        <li>Can pool resources with roommates/family (flexibility)</li>
        <li>Down payment savings easier (path to ownership)</li>
        <li>Bargaining power against bad landlords (can leave)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>"Won't Help the Truly Desperate"</h3>

      <p><strong>UBI is floor, not ceiling:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keeps: Social Security, disability benefits, veterans benefits</li>
        <li>Keeps: Medicare for All (healthcare separate)</li>
        <li>Keeps: Housing assistance for severely disabled/elderly</li>
        <li>Universal means everyone gets baseline—no one falls through cracks</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Better than current welfare:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>No stigma (everyone receives it)</li>
        <li>No poverty traps (benefits don't phase out with income)</li>
        <li>No bureaucracy (automatic enrollment)</li>
        <li>Portable (not tied to location or employer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Economic Effects</h2>

      <h3>Labor Market Changes</h3>

      <p><strong>Increased worker bargaining power:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can refuse exploitative wages/conditions</li>
        <li>Can leave abusive employers</li>
        <li>Time to find better job match (not desperate for any job)</li>
        <li>Pressure on employers to improve wages and working conditions</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Entrepreneurship and risk-taking:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Security to start businesses (won't starve if fails)</li>
        <li>Can invest time in education/training</li>
        <li>More people pursuing creative work, innovation</li>
        <li>Economic dynamism increases</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Job quality improvements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Worst jobs must improve or disappear (can't rely on desperation labor)</li>
        <li>Shift to higher-value work as low-value jobs automate</li>
        <li>Better match between workers and jobs (less coercion)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Economic Stimulus</h3>

      <p><strong>Demand stabilization:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Guaranteed baseline spending supports local businesses</li>
        <li>Counter-cyclical: UBI continues during recessions</li>
        <li>Reduces severity of economic downturns</li>
        <li>Multiplier effect: every UBI dollar generates $1.50-2 economic activity</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Economic mobility:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Easier to escape poverty (steady income floor)</li>
        <li>Geographic mobility increases (can afford to move)</li>
        <li>Human capital investment (time for education)</li>
        <li>Intergenerational benefits (kids do better when families stable)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Social Benefits</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Health:</strong> Reduced stress, better preventive care, fewer ER visits</li>
        <li><strong>Crime:</strong> Less desperation crime, reduced recidivism (stability upon release)</li>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Parents can spend time with kids, students can focus on school</li>
        <li><strong>Family stability:</strong> Financial stress major cause of divorce—UBI reduces pressure</li>
        <li><strong>Mental health:</strong> Security reduces anxiety and depression</li>
        <li><strong>Community:</strong> People can volunteer, engage civically, build social capital</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Integration with Other Systems</h2>

      <h3>Healthcare (Medicare for All)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>UBI + universal healthcare = complete economic security baseline</li>
        <li>Healthcare free at point of service (no medical bills)</li>
        <li>UBI covers living expenses</li>
        <li>Together eliminate poverty and medical bankruptcy</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Housing System</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Progressive property taxation prevents landlords from capturing UBI through rent increases</li>
        <li>Vacancy penalties ensure housing supply available</li>
        <li>UBI provides stable income for rent/mortgage payments</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Automation Dividend Tax</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Direct funding link: automation → tax → UBI</li>
        <li>Transparent and politically defensible</li>
        <li>Revenue scales with displacement (more automation = more UBI)</li>
        <li>Companies internalize social cost of automation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Worker Protections</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>UBI provides security during job transitions</li>
        <li>Strengthens unions (workers less desperate, better bargaining)</li>
        <li>Complements rather than replaces labor protections</li>
        <li>Enables enforcement (can afford to report violations)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
      
      <p>Policy researchers, economists, and social scientists determine:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Optimal pilot locations and participant selection</li>
        <li>Payment amounts and frequency (monthly vs. quarterly)</li>
        <li>Evaluation methodologies and data collection protocols</li>
        <li>National payment infrastructure and technology systems</li>
        <li>Phase-in schedules balancing speed with fiscal responsibility</li>
        <li>Integration with existing benefit programs (which to keep, consolidate, eliminate)</li>
        <li>Fraud prevention and verification systems</li>
        <li>Tax treatment of UBI payments (taxable vs. non-taxable)</li>
        <li>Inflation monitoring and adjustment mechanisms</li>
        <li>International coordination (preventing migration solely for UBI)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The framework provides direction: universal unconditional cash payments funded by automation dividend, starting with pilots and scaling based on evidence. Experts determine optimal implementation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why This Works</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Addresses automation directly:</strong> Income support when jobs disappear</li>
        <li><strong>Dignity preserved:</strong> Universal = no stigma, no bureaucracy</li>
        <li><strong>Economically sound:</strong> Funded by productivity gains, not deficit spending</li>
        <li><strong>Politically achievable:</strong> Pilots prove concept, build support gradually</li>
        <li><strong>Future-proof:</strong> Scales automatically as automation accelerates</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence-based:</strong> Multiple pilot programs show positive results</li>
        <li><strong>Simple to administer:</strong> No means testing, no bureaucracy, low overhead</li>
        <li><strong>Economically stimulative:</strong> Increased demand supports businesses and jobs</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>UBI is not radical—it's rational.</strong> When technology makes human labor less necessary, society shares the abundance technology creates. This is how we adapt to automation without mass suffering.
