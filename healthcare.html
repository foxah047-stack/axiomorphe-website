    <h1>Healthcare System: Medicare for All</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">Single-payer national health system. Everyone covered automatically from birth. Healthcare is a human right, not a commodity. Free at point of service, federally administered, comprehensive coverage. If Medicare works for seniors, it works for everyone.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Core Principle</h2>
      <p><strong>Healthcare is a human right.</strong> No one should go bankrupt from medical bills. No one should die because they can't afford treatment. No one should skip necessary care because of cost. Single-payer Medicare for All ensures every person receives the care they need, when they need it, without financial burden.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Medicare for All Covers</h2>

      <h3>Comprehensive Medical Care</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary care:</strong> Doctor visits, checkups, preventive care</li>
        <li><strong>Hospital care:</strong> Emergency services, surgeries, inpatient treatment</li>
        <li><strong>Specialist care:</strong> Any specialist, no referrals needed</li>
        <li><strong>Prescription drugs:</strong> All FDA-approved medications with negotiated prices</li>
        <li><strong>Mental health:</strong> Therapy, counseling, psychiatric care, addiction treatment</li>
        <li><strong>Dental care:</strong> Cleanings, fillings, extractions, orthodontics</li>
        <li><strong>Vision care:</strong> Eye exams, glasses, contacts</li>
        <li><strong>Hearing care:</strong> Tests, hearing aids, cochlear implants</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Additional Coverage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reproductive healthcare:</strong> Contraception, prenatal care, abortion services</li>
        <li><strong>Maternity and newborn care:</strong> Delivery, postpartum, pediatric care</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term care:</strong> Nursing homes, assisted living, home healthcare</li>
        <li><strong>Medical equipment:</strong> Wheelchairs, prosthetics, oxygen, durable medical equipment</li>
        <li><strong>Rehabilitation:</strong> Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy</li>
        <li><strong>Palliative and hospice care:</strong> End-of-life comfort and dignity</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Everything medically necessary is covered. No exclusions. No limitations. No fine print.</strong>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Free at Point of Service</h2>
      
      <p><strong>What "free at point of service" means:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No premiums:</strong> You never pay a monthly insurance bill</li>
        <li><strong>No deductibles:</strong> First dollar of care is covered</li>
        <li><strong>No copays:</strong> No payment when you see a doctor or pick up prescriptions</li>
        <li><strong>No coinsurance:</strong> No percentage of bills you must pay</li>
        <li><strong>No surprise bills:</strong> Every provider accepts Medicare, no out-of-network charges</li>
        <li><strong>No medical debt:</strong> Cannot exist under this system</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>You show your Medicare card. You get care. That's it.</strong></p>
        <p>No forms to fill out. No prior authorization. No fighting with insurance companies. No bills in the mail.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>

      <h3>Single-Payer Structure</h3>
      <p><strong>Single-payer means:</strong> One insurance program (Medicare) pays all medical bills. Eliminates the complexity, waste, and cruelty of private insurance.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Federal program:</strong> Administered nationally by expanded Medicare agency, not state-by-state</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic enrollment:</strong> Every citizen and resident covered from birth</li>
        <li><strong>Universal network:</strong> Every doctor, hospital, and clinic accepts Medicare</li>
        <li><strong>Portable:</strong> Coverage follows you anywhere in the country</li>
        <li><strong>Lifelong:</strong> Never lose coverage due to job loss, age, or health status</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Provider Freedom</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Doctors remain independent or work for hospitals (not government employees)</li>
        <li>Patients choose any doctor or hospital they want</li>
        <li>Doctors focus on medicine, not insurance paperwork</li>
        <li>Medical decisions made by doctors and patients, not insurance companies</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Private Insurance</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Eliminated for duplicative coverage.</strong> Private insurance cannot offer coverage for anything Medicare for All covers. This prevents a two-tier system where wealthy get better care.</p>

      <p><strong>Private insurance may exist only for:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Elective cosmetic procedures (plastic surgery for appearance, not reconstruction)</li>
        <li>Experimental treatments not yet approved</li>
        <li>Luxury amenities (private hospital rooms beyond medical necessity)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Private insurance industry for duplicative coverage is eliminated because it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extracts profit from human suffering</li>
        <li>Creates administrative waste (30% overhead vs. 2% for Medicare)</li>
        <li>Denies necessary care to maximize profits</li>
        <li>Makes healthcare unaffordable</li>
        <li>Ties coverage to employment (employer control)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>If it's medically necessary, Medicare covers it. Private insurance has no role.</strong>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why Single-Payer</h2>

      <h3>The Current System is Broken</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>30 million uninsured:</strong> People die from treatable conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Medical bankruptcy:</strong> #1 cause of bankruptcy in America</li>
        <li><strong>Highest costs, worst outcomes:</strong> US spends $12,000 per person, other countries spend $6,000 with better results</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance company profits:</strong> $60+ billion annually from denying care</li>
        <li><strong>Administrative waste:</strong> 30% of healthcare spending goes to insurance bureaucracy</li>
        <li><strong>Tied to employment:</strong> Lose job = lose healthcare during crisis</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Single-Payer Solves These Problems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Universal coverage:</strong> Everyone covered, zero uninsured</li>
        <li><strong>No medical bankruptcy:</strong> Impossible under free system</li>
        <li><strong>Lower costs:</strong> $3-3.5 trillion vs. $4.5 trillion current system</li>
        <li><strong>No profit motive:</strong> Medicare doesn't deny care to make money</li>
        <li><strong>Administrative efficiency:</strong> 2% overhead vs. 30% for private insurance</li>
        <li><strong>Economic freedom:</strong> Start business, change jobs, retire early without fear of losing healthcare</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="comparison">
        <h3>Current System vs. Medicare for All</h3>
        <p><strong>Current System:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>30M uninsured, millions underinsured</li>
          <li>Average family pays $17,000/year (premiums + deductibles)</li>
          <li>Medical bankruptcy common</li>
          <li>Insurance companies deny necessary care</li>
          <li>Can't choose doctor (network restrictions)</li>
          <li>Lose coverage if lose job</li>
          <li>Total cost: $4.5 trillion/year</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Medicare for All:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Everyone covered</li>
          <li>Average family pays $4-6,000/year (4% income tax)</li>
          <li>Medical bankruptcy impossible</li>
          <li>Care based on need, not profit</li>
          <li>Any doctor, any hospital</li>
          <li>Coverage never ends</li>
          <li>Total cost: $3-3.5 trillion/year</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Result: Better care, lower cost, universal coverage</strong></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How We Pay For It</h2>

      <h3>Progressive Funding Structure</h3>

      <p><strong>Households:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>4% income tax on income over $29,000</li>
        <li>Replaces premiums, deductibles, copays</li>
        <li>Average family saves $11,000/year</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Employers:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>7.5% payroll tax</li>
        <li>Saves money vs. current premiums (average $15,000/employee)</li>
        <li>New cost: ~$8,000/employee</li>
        <li>Savings can go to wages</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Additional Revenue:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wealth tax on extreme fortunes</li>
        <li>Progressive income tax on top earners</li>
        <li>Close corporate tax loopholes</li>
        <li>Tax on financial transactions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Total Cost Comparison</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Current system:</strong> $4.5 trillion/year</li>
        <li><strong>Medicare for All:</strong> $3-3.5 trillion/year</li>
        <li><strong>Savings:</strong> $1-1.5 trillion annually</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Medicare for All costs LESS than the current system while covering everyone.</strong></p>
        <p>We already pay for healthcare. We're just paying more for worse coverage. Single-payer redirects money from insurance company profits and administrative waste into actual care.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">

        <li>Income support during transition period</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Addressing Common Concerns</h2>

      <h3>"What about wait times?"</h3>
      <p><strong>Americans already wait.</strong> Wait for insurance approval. Wait to save money for deductible. Wait until condition becomes emergency. Medicare for All eliminates insurance delays and expands capacity by redirecting 30% administrative waste into hiring doctors and nurses.</p>

      <h3>"Will I lose my doctor?"</h3>
      <p><strong>No. You keep your doctor.</strong> Private insurance restricts which doctors you can see (networks). Medicare for All means EVERY doctor accepts Medicare. You get MORE choice, not less.</p>

      <h3>"Can government run healthcare?"</h3>
      <p><strong>Medicare already does, with 90% satisfaction.</strong> Medicare has 2% overhead vs. 30% for private insurance. Veterans Affairs healthcare scores higher than private insurance on quality measures. Government-run healthcare works better than private when profit motive is removed.</p>

      <h3>"What about innovation?"</h3>
      <p><strong>Most medical research is publicly funded already.</strong> NIH funds basic research. Medicare for All can increase research funding using savings from administrative efficiency. Drug companies spend more on advertising than research—that money can go to actual innovation.</p>

      <h3>"This is too expensive!"</h3>
      <p><strong>It costs LESS than current system.</strong> We spend $4.5 trillion now. Medicare for All costs $3-3.5 trillion. That's $1+ trillion in savings while covering everyone. The question isn't "can we afford it?"—it's "how can we afford NOT to do it?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why Now</h2>
      
      <p>The healthcare crisis is worsening:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Premiums up 50% in last decade</li>
        <li>Deductibles so high insurance is worthless</li>
        <li>Medical debt epidemic</li>
        <li>Insurance companies using AI to deny care</li>
        <li>People dying because they can't afford insulin</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Every other developed nation provides universal healthcare.</strong> UK, Canada, France, Germany, Australia, Japan, South Korea—all have systems ensuring healthcare for all. America is the outlier. We can do this. We must do this.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Healthcare is a human right. Medicare for All makes it real.</strong>
