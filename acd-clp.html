    <h1>Adaptive Citizen Dividend (ACD) System</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">Three-layer adaptive income system that replaces traditional Universal Basic Income. Everyone receives a universal base plus productivity share from automation gains. Additional compensation for difficult, dangerous, or rare work. Not a handout—it's property rights plus fair compensation.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why Not Traditional UBI</h2>
      
      <p><strong>The problem with fixed Universal Basic Income:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Everyone gets same amount regardless of work difficulty</li>
        <li>Doesn't reflect reality of different contributions</li>
        <li>Rigid brackets (like old tax system) don't adapt</li>
        <li>Garbage collector and office worker get same payment despite vastly different job demands</li>
        <li>Emergency room nurse doing night shifts paid same as comfortable remote work</li>
        <li>No recognition of danger, complexity, or scarcity</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>The insight:</strong> If wealth tax uses incremental curves and housing tax adapts to function, why should income support be one-size-fits-all? The entire framework is adaptive—income must be too.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>The Three-Layer Structure</h2>

      <p>The Adaptive Citizen Dividend has three distinct components that work together:</p>

      <h3>Layer 1: Base Floor (Universal & Unconditional)</h3>
      
      <p><strong>What it is:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Guaranteed minimum for survival and dignity</li>
        <li>Indexed to regional cost of living (automatically adjusts monthly/quarterly)</li>
        <li>Everyone gets this—no conditions, no means test, no exceptions</li>
        <li>You receive this whether working or not</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Funding source:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automation Dividend Tax (primary source)</li>
        <li>Wealth Tax (supplemental)</li>
        <li>Progressive income tax (supplemental)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Why this is NOT a handout:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>You're a shareholder:</strong> Automation created wealth using collective infrastructure (roads, schools, legal system, electricity grid—all public goods)</li>
        <li><strong>Property right:</strong> You own a share of that infrastructure; this is your dividend</li>
        <li><strong>Direct link:</strong> Machines replaced human labor using public resources—you get your share of the productivity</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Regional adjustment examples:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>San Francisco: $1,800/month (high cost of living)</li>
          <li>Kansas City: $1,000/month (moderate cost)</li>
          <li>Rural Mississippi: $850/month (lower cost)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Amount adjusts automatically based on housing, food, and energy prices in your area.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Layer 2: Productivity Share (Dynamic Growth)</h3>
      
      <p><strong>What it is:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your share of national automation gains</li>
        <li>Rises as automation increases productivity</li>
        <li>Quarterly adjustments based on Automation Dividend Tax revenue</li>
        <li>Everyone gets same productivity share (universal)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="formula">
<strong>Total ACD = Base Floor + (Total ADT Revenue ÷ Population)</strong>

Example trajectory:
• 2026: Base $1,000 + Productivity $200 = $1,200/month
• 2030: Base $1,200 + Productivity $600 = $1,800/month  
• 2035: Base $1,500 + Productivity $1,500 = $3,000/month
• 2040: Base $2,000 + Productivity $3,000 = $5,000/month
      </div>

      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>As automation accelerates, YOUR income automatically increases</li>
        <li>Direct link: more robots working = more money for you</li>
        <li>You benefit from technological progress instead of being harmed by it</li>
        <li>No legislation needed for raises—system adjusts automatically</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Layer 3: Compensatory Labor Premium (CLP)</h3>
      
      <p><strong>What it is:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Additional payment for working difficult, dangerous, or rare jobs</li>
        <li>Added ON TOP OF market wages and ACD</li>
        <li>Recognizes that some human work is genuinely harder</li>
        <li>Mandatory employer contribution (like payroll tax)</li>
        <li>Ensures difficult jobs can't be underpaid</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Five scoring factors (each rated 0-10):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Danger:</strong> Physical risk of injury, death, or chronic health issues (OSHA data, injury rates)</li>
        <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Cognitive load, years of training, expertise required, decision-making responsibility</li>
        <li><strong>Undesirability:</strong> Night shifts, weekends, physical strain, emotional toll, environmental exposure</li>
        <li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> Shortage of qualified workers, difficulty filling positions, rare skills</li>
        <li><strong>Social Value:</strong> Essential services, public good contribution, societal benefit</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="formula">
<strong>Monthly CLP Calculation:</strong>

CLP = (Danger Score × $500)
    + (Complexity Score × $600)
    + (Undesirability Score × $400)  
    + (Scarcity Score × $700)
    + (Social Value Score × $800)

Total Employment Income = Market Wage + CLP
Total Monthly Income = ACD + Market Wage + CLP
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Comprehensive Examples</h2>

      <h3>Example 1: Emergency Room Nurse</h3>
      
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Base ACD (everyone gets this):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Regional floor: $1,200/month</li>
          <li>Productivity share: $800/month</li>
          <li><strong>Total ACD: $2,000/month</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Employment income:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Market wage: $5,500/month ($66,000/year base salary)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Compensatory Labor Premium (CLP):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Danger (exposure to disease, violence): 7/10 × $500 = <strong>$3,500</strong></li>
          <li>Complexity (medical training, life-death decisions): 8/10 × $600 = <strong>$4,800</strong></li>
          <li>Undesirability (night shifts, weekends, holidays): 6/10 × $400 = <strong>$2,400</strong></li>
          <li>Scarcity (nursing shortage): 7/10 × $700 = <strong>$4,900</strong></li>
          <li>Social value (essential healthcare): 9/10 × $800 = <strong>$7,200</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Total CLP: $22,800/month</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Total monthly income: $30,300 (~$364,000/year)</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> ER nursing is physically demanding, emotionally draining, and dangerous. Current system pays ~$70K and wonders why there's a shortage. ACD system recognizes the true difficulty and compensates accordingly. Nurse feels valued, not exploited.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Example 2: Creative Artist (Full-Time)</h3>
      
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Base ACD:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Regional floor: $1,000/month</li>
          <li>Productivity share: $800/month</li>
          <li><strong>Total ACD: $1,800/month</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Employment income:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Market wage: $0 (building career, not selling much yet)</li>
          <li>CLP: $0 (not working a traditional "job")</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Education/Skills bonus:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Studying animation at community college</li>
          <li>State identifies "creative content creation" as high-demand (entertainment economy)</li>
          <li><strong>Skills supplement: $1,200/month (3 years during training)</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Total during training: $3,000/month</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Total after training: $1,800/month + whatever they earn from art</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Can pursue creative career without starving. ACD provides security to take risks. Skills supplement encourages development of valuable creative abilities. If they succeed commercially, they keep those earnings on top of ACD. If they don't, they still have dignity.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Example 3: Rural Primary Care Doctor</h3>
      
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Base ACD:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Regional floor: $900/month (rural area, lower cost)</li>
          <li>Productivity share: $800/month</li>
          <li><strong>Total ACD: $1,700/month</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Employment income:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Market wage: $12,000/month ($144,000/year base salary)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Compensatory Labor Premium (CLP):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Danger (infectious diseases, emergencies): 4/10 × $500 = <strong>$2,000</strong></li>
          <li>Complexity (medical training, diagnostic expertise): 9/10 × $600 = <strong>$5,400</strong></li>
          <li>Undesirability (on-call 24/7, isolation): 7/10 × $400 = <strong>$2,800</strong></li>
          <li>Scarcity (rural doctor shortage): 9/10 × $700 = <strong>$6,300</strong></li>
          <li>Social value (essential rural healthcare): 10/10 × $800 = <strong>$8,000</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Total CLP: $24,500/month</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Total monthly income: $38,200 (~$458,000/year)</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Rural areas desperately need doctors but can't compete with urban salaries. CLP directly addresses scarcity and undesirability. Doctor is compensated for isolation, long hours, being sole provider for entire community. Solves rural healthcare crisis through proper compensation, not guilt or obligation.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Example 4: Retail Worker</h3>
      
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Base ACD:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Regional floor: $1,100/month</li>
          <li>Productivity share: $800/month</li>
          <li><strong>Total ACD: $1,900/month</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Employment income:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Market wage: $2,400/month ($28,800/year)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Compensatory Labor Premium (CLP):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Danger (occasional violence, theft): 2/10 × $500 = <strong>$1,000</strong></li>
          <li>Complexity (minimal training required): 2/10 × $600 = <strong>$1,200</strong></li>
          <li>Undesirability (weekends, standing all day): 4/10 × $400 = <strong>$1,600</strong></li>
          <li>Scarcity (plenty of workers available): 1/10 × $700 = <strong>$700</strong></li>
          <li>Social value (necessary commerce): 3/10 × $800 = <strong>$2,400</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Total CLP: $6,900/month</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Total monthly income: $11,200 (~$134,000/year)</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Retail is harder than people think—standing all day, dealing with difficult customers. Current system pays minimum wage (~$2,000/month) and complains about turnover. ACD + CLP recognizes the real difficulty. Worker has dignity and fair compensation. Can actually afford life, not just survival.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Example 5: Software Developer</h3>
      
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Base ACD:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Regional floor: $1,500/month (urban tech hub)</li>
          <li>Productivity share: $800/month</li>
          <li><strong>Total ACD: $2,300/month</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Employment income:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Market wage: $10,000/month ($120,000/year)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Compensatory Labor Premium (CLP):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Danger (none): 0/10 × $500 = <strong>$0</strong></li>
          <li>Complexity (requires training but not rare): 6/10 × $600 = <strong>$3,600</strong></li>
          <li>Undesirability (flexible hours, comfortable): 1/10 × $400 = <strong>$400</strong></li>
          <li>Scarcity (moderate shortage): 4/10 × $700 = <strong>$2,800</strong></li>
          <li>Social value (useful but not essential): 4/10 × $800 = <strong>$3,200</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Total CLP: $10,000/month</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Total monthly income: $22,300 (~$268,000/year)</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Tech workers already paid well by market. CLP adds less because work is less difficult/dangerous. But still recognizes complexity and moderate scarcity. Fair compensation without overvaluing comfortable work compared to ER nurse or construction worker.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Example 6: Graduate Student (High-Demand Field)</h3>
      
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Base ACD:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Regional floor: $1,200/month</li>
          <li>Productivity share: $800/month</li>
          <li><strong>Total ACD: $2,000/month</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Skills supplement:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Studying quantum computing (identified as critical shortage area)</li>
          <li>PhD program, 5 years</li>
          <li><strong>Education bonus: $2,500/month</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Total during studies: $4,500/month</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Can focus on studies without working multiple jobs. Incentivizes entering high-demand fields. Society invests in developing rare expertise. After graduation, works in field with high CLP due to rarity/complexity. System creates pipeline for critical skills.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>The Skills Supplement System</h2>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>

      <p><strong>Digital Labor Authority (DLA) identifies shortages:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quarterly analysis of which skills economy needs</li>
        <li>Projects 5-10 years forward based on automation trajectory</li>
        <li>Publishes "High-Demand Skills List"</li>
        <li>Updates dynamically as needs change</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Current example priority list (2026):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Nurses, mental health counselors, physical therapists, home health aides</li>
        <li><strong>Skilled trades:</strong> Electricians, plumbers, HVAC technicians, robotics maintenance</li>
        <li><strong>Creative:</strong> Animation, game design, music production, storytelling, content creation</li>
        <li><strong>Social:</strong> Teachers, social workers, elder care specialists, community organizers</li>
        <li><strong>Technical:</strong> AI ethics, quantum computing, fusion energy, biotech, climate engineering</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Payment Structure</h3>

      <p><strong>Supplement amount based on education level:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Community college/trade school: $1,000-1,500/month</li>
        <li>Bachelor's degree: $1,500-2,500/month</li>
        <li>Master's/Advanced certification: $2,000-3,500/month</li>
        <li>PhD/Medical school: $2,500-4,000/month</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Duration:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Paid for length of program + 2 years after completion</li>
        <li>Encourages people to actually work in the field they studied</li>
        <li>Not tied to grades (this is support, not scholarship competition)</li>
        <li>Can be revoked if switch fields to non-priority area</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Why not just free tuition?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Free tuition doesn't pay rent or food</li>
        <li>People still can't afford to study if they need to work full-time</li>
        <li>This provides real ability to focus on education</li>
        <li>Supports living expenses, not just educational costs</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>The goal:</strong> Remove financial barriers to developing skills society needs. If we need more nurses, make it financially viable to become a nurse. If we need more creative professionals, support people developing those talents. Direct investment in human capital.

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why This System Works</h2>

      <h3>1. Not a Handout—It's Property Rights</h3>

      <p><strong>Shareholder analogy:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Amazon shareholder gets dividends from Amazon's profits</li>
        <li>American citizen gets dividends from America's automated productivity</li>
        <li>Both are property rights, not charity</li>
        <li>Automation used public infrastructure to create wealth—you own a share</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What you own:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Roads, bridges, electricity grid (public infrastructure)</li>
        <li>Education system that trained workforce (public investment)</li>
        <li>Legal system protecting property rights (public service)</li>
        <li>Internet (originally DARPA/government funded)</li>
        <li>All the basic research that enabled technology (NIH, NSF, universities)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Recognizes Real Difficulty</h3>

      <div class="comparison">
        <p><strong>Current system failure:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Market pays based on supply/demand, not difficulty</li>
          <li>Garbage collector does hard, essential work—paid minimum wage</li>
          <li>Social media influencer makes millions posting videos</li>
          <li>Market doesn't reflect actual value or effort</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>CLP correction:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Directly measures danger, difficulty, complexity, scarcity</li>
          <li>Ensures hard jobs pay well regardless of market distortions</li>
          <li>Can't exploit workers in essential but unpleasant jobs</li>
          <li>Social value explicitly factored in</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>3. Self-Adjusting System</h3>

      <p><strong>Automatic responses to change:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>More automation:</strong> Higher ADT revenue → higher productivity share for everyone</li>
        <li><strong>Labor shortage in nursing:</strong> Scarcity score rises → higher CLP → more people enter field</li>
        <li><strong>Cost of living increases:</strong> Regional floor adjusts → purchasing power maintained</li>
        <li><strong>New critical skill emerges:</strong> Added to high-demand list → skills supplement incentivizes training</li>
        <li><strong>Job becomes safer:</strong> Danger score decreases → CLP adjusts (but slowly, to avoid manipulation)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Preserves Work Incentive</h3>

      <div class="comparison">
        <p><strong>Critics ask: "Why work if you get money anyway?"</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Answer: Because work pays WAY more</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>ACD alone: $1,800/month = basic survival</li>
          <li>ACD + easy job: $11,000/month = comfortable life</li>
          <li>ACD + difficult job: $30,000/month = prosperity</li>
          <li>16x multiplier for doing valuable, difficult work</li>
          <li>Very strong incentive to contribute</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>But you have choice:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>If no good jobs available, you don't starve</li>
          <li>Can retrain, relocate, wait for opportunities</li>
          <li>Not desperate, so can negotiate fair wages</li>
          <li>Employers must actually compete for workers</li>
          <li>Bad jobs either improve conditions or can't find workers</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>5. Matches Framework Philosophy</h3>

      <p><strong>Like the wealth tax:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Smooth curves, not rigid brackets</li>
        <li>Adaptive, not fixed</li>
        <li>Responds to changing conditions automatically</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Like the housing system:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Different rates for different functions</li>
        <li>Rewards socially valuable activity</li>
        <li>Discourages harmful behavior (in this case, exploiting workers)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Like the healthcare system:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Universal foundation (everyone covered)</li>
        <li>Eliminates desperation</li>
        <li>Treats as human right</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Integration With Other Systems</h2>

      <h3>Healthcare Connection</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Medical data never used for ACD:</strong> Healthcare silo remains separate</li>
        <li><strong>Can't lose benefits:</strong> Health status doesn't affect income</li>
        <li><strong>No discrimination:</strong> Disabilities don't reduce payments</li>
        <li><strong>Universal healthcare removes fear:</strong> Can retrain without losing coverage</li>
        <li><strong>Medical emergencies:</strong> Don't cause financial ruin (healthcare free + ACD continues)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Justice Connection</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Criminal records not used:</strong> Everyone gets base ACD regardless of past</li>
        <li><strong>Can't be excluded:</strong> Citizen dividend is a right, not a privilege</li>
        <li><strong>CLP available:</strong> Can work in jobs eligible for premium (though some jobs may have restrictions)</li>
        <li><strong>Supports reentry:</strong> Released prisoners have immediate income, reducing recidivism</li>
        <li><strong>Reduces desperation crime:</strong> Basic needs met through ACD</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Housing Connection</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ACD enables choice:</strong> Base income sufficient for rent in most areas</li>
        <li><strong>Can choose location:</strong> Based on preference, not just desperation</li>
        <li><strong>Progressive property tax:</strong> Prevents landlords from capturing all ACD through rent increases</li>
        <li><strong>Vacancy penalties:</strong> Keep housing supply on market, limiting price gouging</li>
        <li><strong>Regional adjustment:</strong> Less inflationary pressure in already expensive areas</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Privacy Connection</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zero-knowledge verification:</strong> Prove eligibility without revealing personal data</li>
        <li><strong>Data silos maintained:</strong> Healthcare, justice, financial data never cross-contaminate</li>
        <li><strong>Automated payments:</strong> No intrusive means testing or monitoring</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy preserved:</strong> What you spend money on is your business</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Addressing Common Concerns</h2>

      <h3>"This is too expensive!"</h3>
      <p><strong>Reality check on costs:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automation tax generates $500B-1T annually (scales with automation)</li>
        <li>Replaces existing programs: welfare, unemployment, disability, food stamps ($600B+)</li>
        <li>Reduces healthcare costs (preventive care, less ER usage): $200B savings</li>
        <li>Reduces crime and incarceration costs: $100B savings</li>
        <li>Economic growth from increased spending: generates additional tax revenue</li>
        <li>Net cost is manageable and drops over time as automation increases revenue</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>"People will be lazy!"</h3>
      <p><strong>Evidence contradicts this:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pilot studies show opposite—people use security to take productive risks</li>
        <li>Work still pays 5-15x more than base (strong incentive)</li>
        <li>Skills supplements incentivize education</li>
        <li>CLP ensures difficult work is well-compensated</li>
        <li>Humans want to contribute and be valued (intrinsic motivation)</li>
        <li>Alaska Permanent Fund shows no employment reduction</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>"How do you measure danger/difficulty objectively?"</h3>
      <p><strong>Existing data infrastructure:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>OSHA already tracks injury/death rates by occupation</li>
        <li>Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks job characteristics</li>
        <li>Worker surveys on conditions (anonymous)</li>
        <li>Educational requirements documented</li>
        <li>Vacancy rates indicate scarcity</li>
        <li>Transparent formulas, publicly auditable</li>
        <li>Appeals process for miscategorized jobs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>"What stops employers from lowering wages?"</h3>
      <p><strong>Multiple protections:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimum wage still exists (indexed to productivity)</li>
        <li>Workers not desperate, can refuse bad offers</li>
        <li>Strong unions with collective bargaining rights protected</li>
        <li>CLP is ON TOP of market wage, not replacement</li>
        <li>Competition for workers in desirable fields</li>
        <li>Wage cuts trigger higher scarcity scores → higher CLP → workers come back</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>"Won't landlords just raise rent?"</h3>
      <p><strong>Housing system prevents this:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Progressive property tax discourages rent extraction</li>
        <li>Vacant property penalties keep supply on market</li>
        <li>Base ACD varies by region (less increase in already expensive areas)</li>
        <li>Zoning reform increases housing supply</li>
        <li>Can move to lower-cost area without losing healthcare or job</li>
        <li>Market competition limits rent increases</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>"Won't this cause inflation?"</h3>
      <p><strong>Not significantly:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Money comes from taxing productivity, not printing</li>
        <li>Replaces existing transfers (net new money is smaller)</li>
        <li>Increased supply (more workers, more production) offsets demand</li>
        <li>Regional adjustment prevents localized overheating</li>
        <li>Competition and supply-side reforms keep prices down</li>
        <li>Alaska Permanent Fund has not caused inflation</li>
      </ul>
